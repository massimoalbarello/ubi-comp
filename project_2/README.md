## Questions
1) the GSR signal we are given is in ohms = skin resistance 
2) skin conductance = 1/R or = tonic component

compare cvxEDA to LPF 0.16Hz and BPF 0.16-2.4Hz 

ECG features: 
* what do you mean by wo psd in the interval [0-2.4Hz]
* what do you mean by 4 psd in [0,0.4]
EDA features: 
* skin conductance as 1/R or we need to extract the phasic and tonic components and skin conductance is the tonic component?
